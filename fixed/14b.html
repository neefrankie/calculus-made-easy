<h1>(b)The Die-away Curve</h1>





<main id="main-content">

<p>If we were to take $p$ as a proper fraction (less than
unity), the curve would obviously tend to sink downwards,
as in Figure 42, where each successive ordinate
is $\frac{3}{4}$ of the height of the preceding one.</p>



<p><img src="33283-t/images/168a.pdf.png-1.png"></p>


<p>The equation is still</p>

<p id="28c4f524-fea5-4a55-8cb6-b5a3063506c0" class="latex-block">\[
y=bp^x
\]</p>

<p>but since $p$ is less than one, $\log_\epsilon p$ will be a negative
quantity, and may be written $-a$; so that $p=\epsilon^{-a}$,
and now our equation for the curve takes the form</p>

<p id="1cdf96c5-6b63-48e8-86e2-75682eb7c6fd" class="latex-block">\[
y=b\epsilon^{-ax}
\]</p>


<p>The importance of this expression is that, in the
case where the independent variable is <em>time</em>, the
equation represents the course of a great many
physical processes in which something is <em>gradually
dying away</em>. Thus, the cooling of a hot body is
represented (in Newton's celebrated “law of cooling”)
by the equation</p>

<p id="45871356-3a13-407a-b7c7-dd042ab399cb" class="latex-block">\[
\theta_t=\theta_0 \epsilon^{-at}
\]</p>

<p>where $\theta_0$ is the original excess of temperature of a
hot body over that of its surroundings, $\theta_t$ the excess
of temperature at the end of time $t$, and $a$ is a constant–namely,
the constant of decrement, depending
on the amount of surface exposed by the body, and
on its coefficients of conductivity and emissivity,
etc.</p>


<p>A similar formula,</p>

<p id="0b92b5f8-8a26-4c22-b88a-a90894ef3485" class="latex-block">\[
Q_t=Q_0 \epsilon^{-at}
\]</p>

<p>is used to express the charge of an electrified body,
originally having a charge $Q_0$, which is leaking away
with a constant of decrement $a$; which constant
depends in this case on the capacity of the body and
on the resistance of the leakage-path.</p>


<p>Oscillations given to a flexible spring die out after
a time; and the dying-out of the amplitude of the
motion may be expressed in a similar way.</p>


<p>In fact $\epsilon^{-at}$ serves as a <em>die-away factor</em> for all
those phenomena in which the rate of decrease
is proportional to the magnitude of that which is
decreasing; or where, in our usual symbols, $\dfrac{dy}{dt}$ is
proportional at every moment to the value that $y$ has
at that moment. For we have only to inspect the
curve, Figure 42 above, to see that, at every part of it,
the slope $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ is proportional to the height $y$; the
curve becoming flatter as $y$ grows smaller. In symbols,
thus

$y=b\epsilon^{-ax}$ or</p>

<p id="aa508ea8-a19f-4c2a-bfad-de0162127634" class="latex-block">\begin{align*}
\log_\epsilon y 
  &= \log_\epsilon b - ax \log_\epsilon \epsilon \\
  &= \log_\epsilon b - ax \\
\end{align*}</p>

<p>and, differentiating,</p>

<p id="fafa5a67-14ff-4031-a079-fdf37ac9a124" class="latex-block">\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{y}\, \frac{dy}{dx} &= -a; \\
\frac{dy}{dx} &= b\epsilon^{-ax} × (-a) = -ay
\end{align*}</p>

<p>or, in words, the slope of the curve is downward, and
proportional to $y$ and to the constant $a$.</p>


<p>We should have got the same result if we had
taken the equation in the form</p>

<p id="d39ec918-c537-4e3b-b992-a10ccd8531a6" class="latex-block">\[
y = bp^x
\]</p>

<p>for then</p>

<p id="0d5ac29d-0e45-414b-a823-6996490de980" class="latex-block">\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = bp^x × \log_\epsilon p
\]</p>

<p>But</p>

<p id="98a39c15-539a-4f37-9769-7bf9e54bee71" class="latex-block">\[
\log_\epsilon p = -a;  
\]</p>

<p>giving us</p>

<p id="22de3d2f-0ee3-4519-a54b-307199acb0c8" class="latex-block">\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = y × (-a) = -ay
\]</p>

<p>as before.</p>

<p><em>The Time-constant.</em></p>

<p>In the expression for the “die-away
factor” $\epsilon^{-at}$, the quantity $a$ is the reciprocal of
another quantity known as “<em>the time-constant</em>,” which
we may denote by the symbol $T$. Then the die-away
factor will be written $\epsilon^{-\frac{t}{T}}$; and it will be seen, by
making $t = T$ that the meaning of $T$ $\left(\text{or of} \dfrac{1}{a}\right)$ is that
this is the length of time which it takes for the original
quantity (called $\theta_0$ or $Q_0$ in the preceding instances)
to die away $\dfrac{1}{\epsilon}$th part–that is to $0.3678$–of its
original value.</p>



<p>The values of $\epsilon^x$ and $\epsilon^{-x}$ are continually required
in different branches of physics, and as they are given
in very few sets of mathematical tables, some of the
values are tabulated here for convenience.</p>

<p>As an example of the use of this table, suppose
there is a hot body cooling, and that at the beginning
of the experiment (<em>i.e.:</em> when $t = 0$) it is $72°$ hotter than
the surrounding objects, and if the time-constant of its
cooling is $20$ minutes (that is, if it takes $20$ minutes
for its excess of temperature to fall to $\dfrac{1}{\epsilon}$ part of $72°$),
then we can calculate to what it will have fallen in
any given time $t$. For instance, let $t$ be $60$ minutes.
Then $\dfrac{t}{T} = 60 ÷ 20 = 3$, and we shall have to find the
value of $\epsilon^{-3}$, and then multiply the original $72°$ by
this. The table shows that $\epsilon^{-3}$ is $0.0498$. So that
at the end of $60$ minutes the excess of temperature
will have fallen to $72° × 0.0498 = 3.586°$.</p>



<hr>


<p><em>Further Examples.</em></p>

<p>(1) The strength of an electric current in a conductor
at a time $t$ secs. after the application of the
electromotive force producing it is given by the expression.</p>

<p id="e52e2912-f286-4879-9be8-30601b0af52d" class="latex-block">\[
C = \dfrac{E}{R}\left\{1 - \epsilon^{-\frac{Rt}{L}}\right\} 
\]</p>

<p>The time constant is $\dfrac{L}{R}$.</p>


<p>If $E = 10$, $R =1$, $L = 0.01$; then when $t$ is very large
the term $\epsilon^{-\frac{Rt}{L}}$ becomes $1$, and $C = \dfrac{E}{R} = 10$; also</p>

<p id="40b198b0-2296-4574-bf63-aea24aea16f3" class="latex-block">\[
\frac{L}{R} = T = 0.01.
\]</p>


<p>Its value at any time may be written:</p>

<p id="a97e73e3-03d3-4c95-8102-bd36e94c8c1c" class="latex-block">\[
C = 10 - 10\epsilon^{-\frac{t}{0.01}},
\]</p>

<p>the time-constant being $0.01$. This means that it
takes $0.01$ sec. for the variable term to fall by
$\dfrac{1}{\epsilon} = 0.3678$ of its initial value $10\epsilon^{-\frac{0}{0.01}} = 10$.</p>


<p>To find the value of the current when $t = 0.001 \text{sec.}$,
say, $\dfrac{t}{T} = 0.1$, $\epsilon^{-0.1} = 0.9048$ (from table).</p>


<p>It follows that, after $0.001$ sec., the variable term
is $0.9048 × 10 = 9.048$, and the actual current is
$10 - 9.048 = 0.952$.</p>


<p>Similarly, at the end of $0.1$ sec.,</p>

<p id="f68443cf-f86b-44c7-90f0-d4aa540bba58" class="latex-block">\[
\frac{t}{T} = 10;\quad \epsilon^{-10} = 0.000045;
\]</p>

<p>the variable term is $10 × 0.000045 = 0.00045$, the current
being $9.9995$.</p>


<p>(2) The intensity $I$ of a beam of light which has
passed through a thickness $l$ cm. of some transparent
medium is $I = I_0\epsilon^{-Kl}$, where $I_0$ is the initial intensity
of the beam and $K$ is a “constant of absorption.”</p>


<p>This constant is usually found by experiments. If
it be found, for instance, that a beam of light has
its intensity diminished by 18% in passing through
$10$ cms. of a certain transparent medium, this means
that $82 = 100 × \epsilon^{-K×10}$ or $\epsilon^{-10K} = 0.82$, and from the
table one sees that $10K = 0.20$ very nearly; hence
$K = 0.02$.</p>


<p>To find the thickness that will reduce the intensity
to half its value, one must find the value of $l$ which
satisfies the equality $50 = 100 × \epsilon^{-0.02l}$, or $0.5 = \epsilon^{-0.02l}$.

It is found by putting this equation in its logarithmic
form, namely,</p>

<p id="5b23069f-fb1a-46e8-a62f-2c1487f383f6" class="latex-block">\[
\log 0.5 = -0.02 × l × \log \epsilon,
\]</p>

<p>which gives</p>

<p id="a0896752-d93c-4103-ac1e-c13966cc4b78" class="latex-block">\[

l = \frac{-0.3010}{-0.02 × 0.4343}
 = 34.7 \text{centimetres nearly}.
\]</p>


<p>(3) The quantity $Q$ of a radio-active substance
which has not yet undergone transformation is known
to be related to the initial quantity $Q_0$ of the substance
by the relation $Q = Q_0 \epsilon^{-\lambda t}$, where $\lambda$ is a constant
and $t$ the time in seconds elapsed since the transformation
began.</p>


<p>For “Radium $A$,” if time is expressed in seconds,
experiment shows that $\lambda = 3.85 × 10^{-3}$. Find the time
required for transforming half the substance. (This
time is called the “mean life” of the substance.)</p>


<p>We have $0.5 = \epsilon^{-0.00385t}$.</p>

<p id="ad1b525e-db08-4865-b271-22c631f103fc" class="latex-block">\begin{align*}
\log 0.5 &= -0.00385t × \log \epsilon; \\
t &= 3\text{ minutes very nearly}.
\end{align*}</p>
