<h1>Curvature of Curves</h1>





<main id="main-content">

<p>Returning to the process of successive differentiation,
it may be asked: Why does anybody want to
differentiate twice over? We know that when the
variable quantities are space and time, by differentiating
twice over we get the acceleration of a
moving body, and that in the geometrical interpretation,
as applied to curves, $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ means the <em>slope</em> of the
curve. But what can $\dfrac{d^2 y}{dx^2}$ mean in this case? Clearly
it means the rate (per unit of length $x$) at which the
slope is changing–in brief, it is <em>a measure of the
curvature of the slope</em>.</p>

<p><img src="33283-t/images/124b.pdf.png-1.png"></p>


<p>Suppose a slope constant, as in Figure 31.</p>


<p>Here, $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ is of constant value.</p>



<p>Suppose, however, a case in which, like Figure 32,
the slope itself is getting greater upwards, then
$\dfrac{d\left(\dfrac{dy}{dx}\right)}{dx}$, that is, $\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}$, will be <em>positive</em>.</p>


<p>If the slope is becoming less as you go to the right
(as in <a href="10.html#figure14">Figure 14</a>), or as in Figure 33, then, even
though the curve may be going upward, since the
change is such as to diminish its slope, its $\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ will
be <em>negative</em>.</p>


<p><img src="33283-t/images/125a.pdf.png-1.png"></p>


<p>It is now time to initiate you into another secret–how
to tell whether the result that you get by
“equating to zero” is a maximum or a minimum.
The trick is this: After you have differentiated
(so as to get the expression which you equate to
zero), you then differentiate a second time, and look
whether the result of the second differentiation is
<em>positive</em> or <em>negative</em>. If $\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ comes out <em>positive</em>, then
you know that the value of $y$ which you got was
a <em>minimum</em>; but if $\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ comes out <em>negative</em>, then

the value of $y$ which you got must be a <em>maximum</em>.
That's the rule.</p>


<p><img src="33283-t/images/126a.pdf.png-1.png"></p>

<p><img src="33283-t/images/126b.pdf.png-1.png"></p>


<p>The reason of it ought to be quite evident. Think
of any curve that has a minimum point in it (like
<a href="10.html#figure15">Figure 15</a>), or like Figure 34, where the point of
minimum $y$ is marked $M$, and the curve is <em>concave</em>
upwards. To the left of $M$ the slope is downward,
that is, negative, and is getting less negative. To the
right of $M$ the slope has become upward, and is
getting more and more upward. Clearly the change
of slope as the curve passes through $M$ is such that
$\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ is <em>positive</em>, for its operation, as $x$ increases toward
the right, is to convert a downward slope into an
upward one.</p>


<p>Similarly, consider any curve that has a maximum
point in it (like <a href="10.html#figure16">Figure 16</a>), or like Figure 35, where
the curve is <em>convex</em>, and the maximum point is
marked $M$. In this case, as the curve passes through $M$
from left to right, its upward slope is converted

into a downward or negative slope, so that in this
case the “slope of the slope” $\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ is <em>negative</em>.</p>


<p>Go back now to the examples of the last chapter
and verify in this way the conclusions arrived at as to
whether in any particular case there is a maximum
or a minimum. You will find below a few worked
out examples.</p>



<hr>


<p>(1) Find the maximum or minimum of</p>

<p id="851e7842-4092-4482-bc7d-f434ab57cb9a" class="latex-block">\begin{align*}
\text{(a)}\quad y &= 4x^2-9x-6; \\
\text{(b)}\quad y &= 6 + 9x-4x^2; \\
\end{align*}</p>

<p>and ascertain if it be a maximum or a minimum in each case.</p>

<p>(a)</p>

<p id="df71c94f-4e01-4696-97a1-09f80fb59cbe" class="latex-block">\begin{align*}
\dfrac{dy}{dx}
  &= 8x-9=0;\quad x=1\tfrac{1}{8}, y = -11.065.\\
\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}
  &= 8
\end{align*}</p>

<p>it is $+$; hence it is a minimum.</p>

<p>(b)</p>

<p id="f75e1c14-f9d4-4da9-9d3e-922f40f9f7ef" class="latex-block">\begin{align*}
{\dfrac{dy}{dx}}
  &= 9-8x=0;\quad x = 1\tfrac{1}{8}; y = +11.065.\\
\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}
  &= -8;
\end{align*}</p>

<p>it is $-$; hence it is a maximum.</p>



<p>(2) Find the maxima and minima of the function
$y = x^3-3x+16$.</p>

<p id="3f1083c3-d88c-4f3a-97b3-891099bbb4ef" class="latex-block">\begin{align*}
\dfrac{dy}{dx}
  &= 3x^2 - 3 = 0;\quad x^2 = 1; x = ±1.\\

\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}
  &= 6x;
\end{align*}</p>

<p>for $x = 1$; it is $+$.</p>

<p>hence $x=1$ corresponds to a minimum $y=14$. For
$x=-1$ it is $-$; hence $x=-1$ corresponds to a maximum
$y=+18$.</p>



<p>(3) Find the maxima and minima of $y=\dfrac{x-1}{x^2+2}$.</p>

<p id="0baa1e95-34e3-4764-a237-26b806659c32" class="latex-block">\begin{align*}
\frac{dy}{dx} &= \frac{(x^2+2) × 1 - (x-1) × 2x}{(x^2+2)^2} \\
  &= \frac{2x - x^2 + 2}{(x^2 + 2)^2} \\
  &= 0;
\end{align*}</p>

<p>or $x^2 - 2x - 2 = 0$, whose solutions are $x =+2.73$ and
$x=-0.73$.</p>

<p id="d5978aaa-5575-4602-808d-ae532c10c1ea" class="latex-block">\begin{align*}
\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}
  &= - \frac{(x^2 + 2)^2 × (2x-2) - (x^2 - 2x - 2)(4x^3 + 8x)}{(x^2 + 2)^4} \\
  &= - \frac{2x^5 - 6x^4 - 8x^3 - 8x^2 - 24x + 8}{(x^2 + 2)^4}.
\end{align*}</p>




<p>The denominator is always positive, so it is sufficient
to ascertain the sign of the numerator.</p>


<p>If we put $x = 2.73$, the numerator is negative; the
maximum, $y = 0.183$.</p>


<p>If we put $x=-0.73$, the numerator is positive; the
minimum, $y=-0.683$.</p>


<p>(4) The expense $C$ of handling the products of a
certain factory varies with the weekly output $P$
according to the relation $C = aP + \dfrac{b}{c+P} + d$, where
$a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ are positive constants. For what output
will the expense be least?</p>

<p id="50721d4b-94c6-4858-9c77-9ceed2baa3bf" class="latex-block">\[
\dfrac{dC}{dP} = a - \frac{b}{(c+P)^2} = 0
\]</p>

<p>for maximum or minimum;</p>

<p>hence $a = \dfrac{b}{(c+P)^2}$ and $P = ±\sqrt{\dfrac{b}{a}} - c$.</p>


<p>As the output cannot be negative, $P=+\sqrt{\dfrac{b}{a}} - c$.</p>

<p>Now</p>

<p id="cebc5e98-3223-4df0-b0b6-bcb4a35f4e15" class="latex-block">\begin{align*}
\frac{d^2C}{dP^2} &= + \frac{b(2c + 2P)}{(c + P)^4},
\end{align*}</p>

<p>which is positive for all the values of $P$; hence
$P = +\sqrt{\dfrac{b}{a}} - c$ corresponds to a minimum.</p>


<p>(5) The total cost per hour $C$ of lighting a building
with $N$ lamps of a certain kind is</p>

<p id="0e7ed13e-9e12-446f-9bfa-3300ad84c189" class="latex-block">\[
C = N\left(\frac{C_l}{t} + \frac{EPC_e}{1000}\right),
\]</p>

<p>where $E$ is the commercial efficiency (watts per candle),

$P$ is the candle power of each lamp,<br>
$t$ is the average life of each lamp in hours,<br>
$C_l =$ cost of renewal in pence per hour of use,<br>
$C_e =$ cost of energy per $1000$ watts per hour.<br></p>


<p>Moreover, the relation connecting the average life
of a lamp with the commercial efficiency at which it
is run is approximately $t = mE^n$, where $m$ and $n$ are
constants depending on the kind of lamp.</p>


<p>Find the commercial efficiency for which the total
cost of lighting will be least.</p>

<p>We have</p>

<p id="945c395d-522b-4acc-bcb7-6cdf4908dedf" class="latex-block">\begin{align*}
C &= N\left(\frac{C_l}{m} E^{-n} + \frac{PC_e}{1000} E\right), \\
\dfrac{dC}{dE}
  &= \frac{PC_e}{1000} - \frac{nC_l}{m} E^{-(n+1)} = 0
\end{align*}</p>

<p>for maximum or minimum.</p>

<p id="339ab378-8ba1-4d1a-8737-f7a17f6e55a4" class="latex-block">\begin{align*}
E^{n+1} &= \frac{1000 × nC_l}{mPC_e} \\
E &= \sqrt[n+1]{\frac{1000 × nC_l}{mPC_e}}.
\end{align*}</p>



<p>This is clearly for minimum, since</p>

<p id="f298c88f-f2d7-4861-ae0d-e1fc6e2c1f11" class="latex-block">\[
\frac{d^2C}{dE^2} = (n + 1) \frac{nC_l}{m} E^{-(n+2)},
\]</p>

<p>which is positive for a positive value of $E$.</p>


<p>For a particular type of $16$ candle-power lamps,
$C_l= 17$ pence, $C_e=5$ pence; and it was found that
$m=10$ and $n=3.6$.</p>

<p id="ba87e04f-b9a9-411e-a74b-957e39939d11" class="latex-block">\[
E = \sqrt[4.6]{\frac{1000 × 3.6 × 17}{10 × 16 × 5}}
  = 2.6\text{ watts per candle-power}.
\]</p>
